A port of THDF for the NES.

# The THDF legacy

*THDF* (Treasure-Hunter Dragon-Fighter) was the first game I ever made. It was terrible. It ran in javascript `alert()` boxes.

*THDF 2* was the first game I made in C++. It was better. Not good, but better.

*THDF 3: Iota Crawler* was the first game I made with actual graphics. Also terrible. And never finished. It was dubbed "Iota Crawler" by one of my friends because it was a dungeon-crawl featuring my character, Iota.

This is *THDF 4: Iota Crawler 2*, my first NES game. It will probably also be terrible. But, it's a tradition now for me to make a THDF game when I'm learning new programming stuffs.

# Dependancies

You will need [`asm6f`](https://github.com/freem/asm6f) installed to compile the program into a 6502 ROM file.
